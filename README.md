Our WordPress blogs all run on the same theme: StateWatch. This theme was adapted from the Argo Foundation (it began as a child theme and still contains many `argo_`-prefixed functions) and is built around many of the lessons learned in Project Argo.

Below is an outline of the theme's codebase. Top-level files control parts of the theme's presentation (`loop.php` and `404.php`) or are page templates (`about.php`).
